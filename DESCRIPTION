Description: This package contains the functions written by
    Andreas Matzinger that were originally located in the script
    "OgRe_LoadModel_functions.R".  Since this script was copied by some
    students and then adapted there are many duplicated functions now. I
    (Hauke) will replace those functions in the copied scripts that did
    not change at all with "links" to the original functions in this
    package.
