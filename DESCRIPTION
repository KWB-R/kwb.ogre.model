Description: This package contains the functions written by Andreas Matzinger
    that were originally located in the script "OgRe_LoadModel_functions.R".
    Since this script was copied by some students and then adapted there are many
    duplicated functions now. I (Hauke) will replace those functions in the copied
    scripts that did not change at all with "links" to the original functions in
    this package.
Imports:
    kwb.odm,

    kwb.utils,
